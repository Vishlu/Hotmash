🚀 Welcome to HOTMASH – a Django-based web app inspired by FaceMash!
In this project, I built an interactive platform where users can vote between two images (actresses) to decide **“Who’s Hotter? Pick your queen of the screen!” 👑🔥

✨ Features

1) Upload and manage actress images with custom validation.
2) Side-by-side image comparison with a voting system.
3) Voting powered by the Elo Rating System (used in chess rankings) for fair scoring.
4) Simple vote counter for basic ranking (with Elo as an advanced option).
5) Responsive and easy-to-use web interface.

📊 Dataset

1) 330 actress photos scraped from IMDb across the world. 🌍
2) Automated scraping using Python tools (BeautifulSoup / Selenium).
3) Dataset used to populate the voting system for global actress comparisons.

🛠 Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Django
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Data Handling: SQLite3
Web Scraping & Automation: BeautifulSoup / Selenium
